TITLE: 
CCPA upgrade (v3.0.0)
 
- Update of regression coefficients 
- Change of 3-hourly CCPA for poor quality of Stage IV hourly in CNRFC
- Change of CCPA rerun schedule
- Addition of 2.5 km NDGD grid analysis
- Change of product output directory and output file names

CHANGE REQUEST CLASS: 
Major change 

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE:  

CCPA upgrade will update the regression coefficients with extended historical training data sets from
2002 to 2015; Change the computation of weights used in downscaling from 6-hourly CCPA to 3-hourly CCPA
by using Stage II to replace Stage IV data in CNRFC where the latter has poor quality; extend the CCPA
look-back period by following the Stage IV update schedule in recent 2015 implementation of the 
RTMA/URMA upgrade, and thus by making additional runs at 1/3/5/7 days past the valid date; add 2.5 km NDGD
grid analysis.
 
Required changes in the following files:

  1) ecf/jccpa_conus_00.ecf&jccpa_conus_12.ecf
   - Added to follow NCO WCOSS Implementation Standards v10.0.0

  2) versions/ccpa.ver
   - Added to define the version of CCPA

  3) jobs/JCCPA_CONUS
   - Modified to change the CCPA rerun schedule
   - Modified to follow NCO WCOSS Implementation Standards v10.0.0

  4) scripts/exccpa_conus.sh.ecf
   - Modified to add 2.5 km NDGD grid analysis products
   - Modified to optimize the script using for loop 
   - Modified to follow NCO WCOSS Implementation Standards v10.0.0

  5) ush/ccpa_6h_to_3h.sh
   - Modified to follow NCO WCOSS Implementation Standards v10.0.0

  6) ush/ccpa_rfcqpe_adjust.sh
   - Modified to follow NCO WCOSS Implementation Standards v10.0.0

  7) ush/ccpa_copygb_pcp.sh
   - Modified to add 2.5 km NDGD grid analysis products
   - Modified to follow NCO WCOSS Implementation Standards v10.0.0

  8) sorc/README.build, Module_CCPA_v3.0.0, build.sh, install.sh
     sorc/*/makefile
   - Added/modified to pass libraries through module files

  9) sorc/ccpa_comp_st4_st2_3h_files.fd
   - Modified to use Stage II hourlies as weights in both NWRFC and CNRFC instead of NWRFC only 
    
  10) fix/CCPA_CONUS_reg_coef_8thd
   - Modified to replace with a new set of regression coefficients

BENEFIT OF CHANGE: 

By updating regression coefficients by extending training data sets, this upgrade will improve analysis quality.
Using Stage II hourly in both NWRFC and CNRFC instead of NWRFC only will obtain better weights and thus improve
3-hourly analysis. Changing CCPA rerun schedule will improve analysis with more accurate Stage IV inputs. 

USER IMPACT STATEMENT:

External community will pay attention to product directory structure and file name changes. 
There will be significant changes to the current CCPA output file names. The community will be informed of these changes 
via 30-day parallel run , with an evaluation of relevant collaborators/users. A TIN will be issued.

TECHNICAL IMPACT STATEMENT:

Some impacts to data distributed via all distribution platforms are specified. Furthermore, due to the change of rerun 
schedule, the product is subject to dynamic updates and finalized at 8 days after the valid date. Therefore, it is 
recommended that it should save the data the current date 8 days ago for data archive.
