TITLE: 
CCPA upgrade (v4.0.0)
 
- Update of regression coefficients 
- Change of 3-hourly CCPA for improved quality of Stage IV hourly in NWRFC and CNRFC
- Addition of 1-hourly analysis

CHANGE REQUEST CLASS: 
Major change 

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE:  

CCPA upgrade will update the regression coefficients with extended historical training data sets from
2002 to 2017; Change the computation of weights used in downscaling from 6-hourly CCPA to 3-hourly CCPA
by using Stage IV hourly data only over CONUS including NWRFC and CNRFC where these areas have improved 
quality  in recent implementation of the RTMA/URMA v2.6 upgrade on 12/13/2017; add 1 hourly analysis.
 
Required changes in the following files:

  1) ecf/jccpa_conus_00.ecf&jccpa_conus_12.ecf
   - Removed and replaced with other three files in 2)

  2) ecf/ccpa_test.def&jccpa_conus.ecf&jccpa_gempak.ecf
   - Added and modified to increase computer nodes from 1 to 5 

  3) jobs/JCCPA_CONUS
   - Modified to change the CCPA running order
   - Modified to change job runs from serial to 5 parallels

  4) scripts/exccpa_conus.sh.ecf
   - Modified to add 1-hourly analysis products
   - Modified to change 2.5km ndgd grid as MDL/NBM specified

  5) ush/ccpa_6h_to_3h.sh
   - Modified slightly for data input path
   - Modified to use Stage IV hourly data only

  6) ush/ccpa_6h_to_1h.sh
   - Added to produce 1-hourly analysis products using Stage IV hourly data only 

  7) ush/ccpa_copygb_pcp.sh
   - Modified to change 0.5 degree analysis products

  8) sorc/Module_CCPA_v4.0.0
   - Added to replace sorc/Module_CCPA_v3.0.0 for consistency

  9) sorc/ccpa_comp_st4_st2_3h_files.fd
   - Removed to use Stage IV hourly data only
    
  10 sorc/ccpa_6h_to_1h.fd 
   - Added to produce 1-hourly analysis products using Stage IV hourly data only

  11) fix/CCPA_CONUS_reg_coef_8thd
   - Modified to replace with a new set of regression coefficients

BENEFIT OF CHANGE: 

By updating regression coefficients with extended training data sets, this upgrade will improve analysis quality.
Using improved Stage IV hourly in NWRFC and CNRFC will obtain better weights and thus improve 3-hourly analysis. 
Adding 1-hourly CCPA will support MDL's National Blend of Model (NBM) project. 

USER IMPACT STATEMENT:

External community will pay attention to the new 1-hourly products and their file names. 
There will be no significant changes to the current CCPA output data structure and file names. 
The community will be informed of these changes via 30-day parallel run, with an evaluation of 
relevant collaborators/users. A TIN will be issued.

TECHNICAL IMPACT STATEMENT:

Some impacts to data distributed via all distribution platforms are specified. Furthermore, due to the change of rerun 
schedule from last implementation, the product is subject to dynamic updates and finalized at 8 days after the valid date. 
Therefore, it is recommended that it should save the data the current date 8 days ago for data archive.
