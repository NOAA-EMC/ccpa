BENEFIT OF CHANGE: 

By updating regression coefficients with extended training data sets, this upgrade will improve analysis quality. 
Adding 1-hourly CCPA will support MDL's National Blend of Model (NBM) project. 

USER IMPACT STATEMENT:

External community will pay attention to the new 1-hourly products and their file names. 
There will be no significant changes to the current CCPA output data structure and file names. 
The community will be informed of these changes via 30-day parallel run, with an evaluation of 
relevant collaborators/users. A TIN will be issued.

TECHNICAL IMPACT STATEMENT:

Some impacts to data distributed via all distribution platforms are specified. Furthermore, due to the change of rerun 
schedule from last implenmentation, the product is subject to dynamic updates and finalized at 8 days after the valid date. 
Therefore, it is recommended that it should save the data the current date 8 days ago for data archive.
